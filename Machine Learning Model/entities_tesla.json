use its technology.", "Tesla was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and this policy is intended to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting Tesla, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world.", "Tesla\u2019s Pledge\n\nTesla irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith.", "A list of Tesla Patents subject to the Pledge will be maintained at the following URL: https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-list.", "A party is \"acting in good faith\" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:\n\nasserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;\nchallenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or\nmarketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.", "Transfer of Tesla Patents\n\nShould Tesla ever transfer a Tesla Patent to a third party, it will do so only to a party that agrees, by means of a public declaration intended to be binding on such party, to provide the same protection that Tesla provided under the Pledge and to place the same requirement on any subsequent transferee.", "In order for Tesla to preserve its ability to enforce the Tesla Patents against any party not acting in good faith, the Pledge is not a waiver of any patent claims (including claims for damages for past acts of infringement) and is not a license, covenant not to sue, or authorization to engage in patented activities or a limitation on remedies, damages or claims.", "What this pledge means is that as long as someone uses our patents for electric vehicles and doesn\u2019t do bad things, such as knocking off our products or using our patents and then suing us for intellectual property infringement, they should have no fear of Tesla asserting its patents against them.", "Tesla Conflict Minerals Report\n\nDownload PDF\n\nLast Updated May 2020\n\nTesla Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nDownload PDF\n\nLast

practice.", "Tesla does not warrant the safety or operability of salvaged vehicles.", "Repairs performed to bring a salvaged vehicle back into service may not meet Tesla standards or specifications and that is why the vehicle is unsupported.", "Until Tesla can confirm that the vehicle is in compliance with Tesla\u2019s safety standards and vehicle specifications, Tesla does not perform or support repairs involving the HV (high-voltage) battery systems in the vehicle because of the potential for the salvage vehicle to have sustained damage that:\n\nMakes the vehicle unsafe to

either by the condition of the vehicle or by vehicle modifications not installed by Tesla.", "If the Tesla Service Center determines that the vehicle is not safe to repair, the recall-related repair will not be performed until the customer has returned the vehicle to a condition that the Service Center determines is safe to repair.", "For more information about this policy, please contact a Tesla Service Center.", "Tesla\u2019s mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.", "Approach to risk management and governance in relation to UK taxation\n\nTesla is
