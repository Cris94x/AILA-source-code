Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Tesla products comply with the laws regarding conflict minerals, slavery, child labor and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business;
Discipline employees or contractors, including potential termination of contract, who fail to meet Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;
Train certain Tesla employees regarding conflict minerals, human trafficking, child labor and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the Tesla's supply chain;
Investigate if Tesla has a reasonable basis to believe that a Tesla supplier is engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals; and
Transition away from purchasing goods or services from any supplier that is believed to be engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals if the supplier does not take corrective actions within a reasonable period of time.</td>
